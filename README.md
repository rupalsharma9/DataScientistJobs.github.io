The original dataset for this project was downloaded from kaggle.

The tools that have been used in this analytics project are:

1. Google Spreadsheets
2. SQL
3. Tableau 

I.  Google Spreadsheets :
The dataset that was downloaded had some inconsistencies, duplicate values and unorganised data. 

   i. The first extraction took place in the Company Name and rating column : Split function was used with space as a delimiter to separate rating from name of company column. Similarly location and job location code were separeted.

  ii. The upper lower and average salary of employees were also cleaned and formatted.

  iii. From the job description the skill required (ie python aws tableau etc) were also extracted and placed in different columns). Here 0 means that that skill was not required and 1 means the skill for that particular job was required.

2. SQL :
MySQL workbench was used in this project for data exploration purpose. Using MySQL different column names were altered and different queries were run to identify the pattern and relationship in data. 

3. Tableau :
The MySQL database was then connected with tableau to make dashboards and different visualisation using the data.
